                        <p>In 2018, claims of sexual harassment from seven women at Relativity against former Relativity Co-President Adam Fields was found to have been the result of a fraudulent memorandum drafted, according to the arbitrator Judge Terry Friedman, by Relativity CEO Ryan Kavanaugh himself. The attorney who Kavanaugh testified authored the memo, denied authoring the memo during her deposition and was not employed by Relativity when it was created. As a result, the arbitrator awarded Fields $8.44M. After a forensic audit of the computer was conducted, it was found that the memo had been generated from someone who signed in as “kav, kav”.</p>

                        <p>In 2021, Kavanaugh's former babysitter for his newborn child sued him over an alleged $175,000 in unpaid wages after being abruptly fired 2 months into her 13-month contract. Maureen Russell's Los Angeles Superior Court lawsuit allegations against Ryan Kavanaugh include breach of a written employment contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, failure to pay overtime wages and failure to furnish accurate wage statements. The two reached a written deal on June 28 for her to babysit for the child 12 hours a day, four days a week from June 26 until Sept. 26, 2020 and 24 hours daily from Sept. 27, 2020 through July 27, 2021 — all at $40 an hour, according to the suit. However, Kavanaugh abruptly fired Russell last July 17, citing “child custody issues,” the suit states.</p>

It reads, 'Ethan I am not sure why you have decided to take it upon yourself and you show to malign, attack, slander, and defame me. I do not know you. I also don't know why you're sending thousands i dollars to have thousands of dummy accounts post fake statements about me on my instagram and tens of thousands to have fake App Store reviews of triller. Worse yet you dedicated an entire show of yours reading your own fake reviews. While amusing and slighly annoying at best I would advise you stop and mitigate your damage now. Your toy podcast seems fun and all but this is real business with real consequences and you are causing real damage. Clearly you are a very unhappy and disturbed human to take it upon youself to attack someone you don't know with false and misleading information, especially to spend 10's of thousands of dollars on it, but it must stop. You have been warned and I will not be threatened and maligned and stand by idly. Govern yourself accordingly.'">

                <h3>"How Ryan Kavanaugh Failed To Deliver $1 Million To Chairy" -Variety</h3>
                <p>It was a late fall evening in 2007 in San Pedro. Habitat for Humanity was holding a ceremony with hundreds of volunteers in attendance, including President Jimmy Carter. Ryan Kavanaugh wanted to put on a show. He provided the charity an oversized donation check of $1,000,000 to help the charity build over 250 homes for the poor. That's an amazing thing to do right!? Well, it seems there was a discrepancy between Ryan's oversized check and the actual check. According to Variety, KavKav only ended up donating a measly $35,000. Variety further reported: “The failure caused disillusionment inside the non-profit and also some embarrassment — because the development came at the end of a weeklong event that was the charity's biggest in years, with former President Jimmy Carter in attendance. Said one key supporter of the charity, who asked not to be named: “No one had ever done something like that before. To get the kind of attention he did, in front of a U.S. president, and then to do nothing for it, was all just so shocking.”</p>
